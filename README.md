# GitHub Copilot - Testing Challenge

In order to practice what we have learned so far, we will be working on a testing challenge. The challenge consists of creating an automation test suite for an API of a [Banking Portal.](https://github.com/abhi9720/BankingPortal-API)

## Challenge
From scratch, create a test automation project in any programming language and framework of your choice, but it should fulfill the following requirements:
1. The project should be implemented using GitHub Copilot.
2. The tests should be written using Gerkin syntax, it means the project should implement a BDD framework.
3. The project should implement a dependency management tool (e.g. Maven).
4. The project should generate a report after running the tests.
5. Create a Pipeline that runs all the tests and generates a report, you can use any CI/CD tool of your choice and with the help of Copilot write the infraestructure code needed.
6. Create test cases for at least the following features:
    - Register user
    - Login user
